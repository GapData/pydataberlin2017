# pydataberlin2017
Slides and code for PyData Berlin 2017, Introduction to Julia, tutorial.


This will be an interactive workshop using jupyter notebooks. Please bring your laptop, with the following minimum software installed:
- Julia (version 0.5.2 or greater)
- Jupyter notebook

It will further speed things enormously if you open Julia at least once on your machine and run from the Julia command prompt
> Pkg.add("IJulia")

This will allow the interaction between Julia and Jupyter to function.

If for some reason you fail to come with a working Julia installation, wifi permitting, it may be possible to follow along on https://www.juliabox.com/

## How to obtain Julia

You can download binaries from https://julialang.org/downloads/ Current options include Windows, MacOS and Linux.

In addition, most Linux distributions come with Julia packages in their repositories. However, these may lag somewhat behind the current rather fast development cycle.

You can also try online via https://www.juliabox.com/ which provides hosted Julia notebooks on Google Cloud.

If you need corporate support, https://juliacomputing.com/products/juliapro.html provides a batteries included installation of Julia. The company is run by some of the creators of the language and provides a single install with all of the most important add-ons.

## Join us at the Julia Users Group - Berlin

After the workshop you may wish to join us at our bi-monthly meet-up in Berlin. Check our [website](http://julia-users-berlin.github.io) or [meet-up.com](https://www.meetup.com/Julia-Users-Group/) for details.
